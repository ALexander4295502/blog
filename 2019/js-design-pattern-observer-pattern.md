JS design pattern - Observer Pattern
============

The Observer is a design pattern in which an object (known as a subject) maintains a list of objects depending on it(observers), automatically notifying them of any changes to state.

When a subject needs to notify observers about something interseting happening, it broadcasts a notification to the observers(which can include specific data related to the topic of the notification).
